# Road Safety Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing road safety measures by analyzing various factors such as urban vs. highway focus, speed management, and hospital infrastructure. The insights and methodologies derived from this project are scalable and can be applied to other urban areas facing similar issues.

## Key Insights
- **Urban vs. Highway Focus**: Road safety measures need to be tailored to specific environments. Different road environments, such as urban areas and highways, demand distinct approaches to enhance road safety.
- **Speed Management**: The correlation between high speeds and Lane Departure Warnings underscores the importance of speed management as a critical road safety measure.
- **Hospital Infrastructure**: Improving the capacity and capability of hospitals along highways, especially by adding trauma centers, can significantly enhance emergency support for accident victims.

## Scalability
The use of AI-based ADAS, the integration of weather data, and the emphasis on hospital development with trauma centers and telemedicine are scalable strategies that can be adapted and implemented in various regions to enhance road safety and emergency response.

## Future Scope
Access to government-provided historical weather data allows us to provide a more comprehensive and detailed weather analysis. This enhanced analysis is particularly valuable for regions in India known for frequent occurrences of high rainfall and fog.

## Methods Used
- **Pandas and NumPy**: These Python libraries were employed for data analysis, allowing us to assess the correlation between the weather conditions and the alerts.
- **QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System)**: QGIS was selected as the preferred Geographic Information System (GIS) tool for this study due to its open-source nature and cost-free availability.

## How to Run
The files can be asily downloaded and run using the software.Please have Python, Pandas and Numpy installed for the notebook and QGIS installed for the GIS Data.
